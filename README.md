## 👋 About me 

My name is Lucas Picollo and I'm from Florianopolis, SC - Brasil. I have been working with software since 2016, currently at the last semester of System Information at UFSC.
###
Nowadays I see the tools I know as a way to solve problems and generate value for everyone involved, so I'm always trying to learn better ways to do so.

## 🌱 I use on daily basis

- Ruby
- Golang
- [Vim](https://github.com/picolloo/dotfiles)

## ⛰️ My goals for 2021

- Create a project that people would really use
- Keep doing live streaming
- Improve my english
- Learn some music theory
